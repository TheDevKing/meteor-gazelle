## Motivation

Users registered on the site may have questions or concerns from time to time. In order to provide a private channel for them to communicate in we provide a support inbox. This provides them the ability to send a message to user classes who have access to the support inbox or to specific user within those groups. Some users (typically staff) have elevated access to the support inbox and rather then sending messages receive them and are responsible for responding to the messages and resolving them.
